<h1>Welcome to the Grateful Wall</h1>
<h2>What is this site? </h2>
<p>		
Its Simple really this site is a list of gratitudes that are all user generated by you and me! Content can be submitted and upvoted pr downvoted by you the user and can be sorted accordingly.The purpose of this site is is provide the visitor with a way to give thanks for the things that are important in their life no matter has small, insignificant or even rediculous. Its important to take time to positively reflect upon the good in our lives and this site allows for people to come together and share this. Inspiration comes from a tedx talk done by Shawn archer which can be watched here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXy__kBVq1M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXy__kBVq1M</a> one of the key takeways from his talk and and his book are that it is important to make a habit of identifying the positive things, influences or people in your life, he promotes the action of writing 3 gratitudes everyday, 3 simple things that you are grateful for that day. No matter whats going on in your life its important to take the time to give thanks and if you can let others in and let them know you are thankful for it will have a cascading effect
