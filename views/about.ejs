    <h2> The Inspiration For This Site</h2>
    </p>
    The inspiration for this site comes fromt a tedx talk done by Shawn archer which can be watched at this link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXy__kBVq1M"> Here </a> or below. One of the key takeways from his talk and and his book are that it is important to make a habit of identifying the positive things, influences or people in your life, he promotes the action of writing 3 gratitudes everyday, 3 simple things that you are grateful for that day. No matter whats going on in your life its important to take the time to give thanks and if you can let others in and let them know you are thankful for it will have a cascading effect.

            When you write down a list of “three good things” that happened that day, your brain will be forced to scan the last 24 hours for potential positive — things that brought small or large laughs, feelings of accomplishment at work, a strengthened connection with family, a glimmer of hope for the future. In just five minutes a day, this trains the brain to become more skilled at noticing and focusing on possibilities for personal and professional growth and seizing opportunities to act on them.
